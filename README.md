# Artifice Network

## Purpose
THe purpose of the Artifice Network is to create a distributed execution environment built around untrusted systems.

## Implementation

### Mealy State Homormophic Encryption
Mealy State Homomorphic Encryption (MeSHE) is a form of homrophic encryption that operates on a cipher text with an available set of instructions, such as addition, multiplication and subtraction.

#### Moore State Homomorphic Encryption
Moore State Homormorphic Encryption (MoSHE) is a form of homorophic encryption in which the code that is run is the same for all operations on cipher text.
